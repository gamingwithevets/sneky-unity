Since [Severus](https://github.com/SeverusJake) who worked on [Sneky](https://github.com/gamingwithevets/Sneky) with me before now uses Unity, I decided to try and remake Sneky entirely in Unity and C#. The snake gameplay code was based on [Zigurous's Unity snake game code](https://github.com/zigurous/unity-snake-tutorial).
